# Agents Playground — Exploring Agentic AI with Agno

Welcome to **Agents**, a hands-on space where I experiment, build, and learn about **Agentic AI** using the [Agno framework](https://docs.agno.ai/). This repository is a collection of my explorations—from simple single agents to multi-agent systems that reason, use tools, and access knowledge.

## What’s Inside?

This repo is structured to reflect my journey in learning Agentic AI:

-  **Simple Agents** — Basic agent behaviors, helping me understand the fundamentals.
-  **Multi-Agent Setups** — Exploring how agents can collaborate or work in parallel.
-  **Agents with Tools** — Giving agents capabilities like search, file access, and API use.
-  **Agents with Knowledge & Reasoning** — Letting agents think through problems and act smartly.

All implementations are adapted from and inspired by the **Agno documentation** — serving as both a sandbox and a study guide.

## Why This?

AI agents are the future of automation, decision-making, and collaboration. By building from scratch and learning hands-on, I'm gaining a deeper intuition of:

- How agents operate internally  
- How to build more capable and autonomous systems  
- How to adapt tools like Agno for real-world use cases  

This repo is my learning log, a coding lab, and a playground for ideas.

## Stay Tuned

I'll continue to update this repository as I dive deeper into more complex architectures, new tools, and real-world applications.

Feel free to explore, fork, and build upon it!
